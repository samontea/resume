\cvitemwithcomment{}{\textbf{FIRST Robotics Team 461--Westside Boiler Invasion}}{2012--2015}
My freshman year on the team I lead development on a website in Rails that had a stupid number of features.
\\
My sophomore year I made a scouting system for recording data on other teams that consisted of a Node-Webkit application for data entry \& viewing and a C program that processed and summarized the data.
It replaced the very high tech paper system we used to use.
The artificial limitations artificially imposed on us at robotics competitions made this a surprisingly difficult problem.
\\
My junior year on the team I programmed the robot in C/C++.
It was awesome to get to do something that did more than make lights blink.
